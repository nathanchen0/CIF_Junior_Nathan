# CIF_Junior_Nathan
This is the entire work from Nathan for CIF Junior 2025


# Week 3
## Advanced guessing game!
1. Added multiple tries
2. Added small hints to make it easier
3. Added an input so the user can set the lower and upper bound
4. Added an extra guess about the number of tries it would take to guess the number

## What does the game look like?

## How can you make a game like this?
1. Install VSCode on your device
2. Add a Python Compiler and Debugger
3. Optional but very useful, Take Free Lesson at CIF to learn more about python!
4. Have Fun!


# Week 4
## 2D lists!
1. We learned about how 2D lists work

I made a weather database that allows people to find the low, high and the conditions of a day using 2D lists. Check weather in week 4 to see the code.

# Starting up a TBAG (Text Based Adventure Game)
We started our first TBAG! This uses questions of some sort to make an adventure game.

Mine is called "The Adventure of 0s and 1s" and it is a code related game with questions that the user will have to answer.

When I print the instructions, I use my own function called setup() which allows me to print it whenever I want to without another chunk of text.

# Week 5
Now that we had our plan out, we got our next class learning about how to make our TBAGs more fun!
1. Using 2D lists, we stored our questions and answers (This makes our code more simple and easy to access)
2. We added function to check answers from the user so that the game is more interactive
3. We also added a list to make sure that no question are repeated
4. I used the randint function and another list to choose questions

Go to week5, tbag2.py to see my game code.
